# Language Assessment Demo

This is a simplified demo version of the Fluency Analyzer that uses shared tables instead of separate user documents.

## Features

- **Simplified Data Management**: All users share the same document and tables
- **Username Validation**: Users enter their username and the system validates it against the central users table
- **Display User Info**: Shows the user's conversation type, topics, and skills (for display purposes only)
- **Random Prompts**: Displays random prompts from the demo prompts table
- **Same Analysis**: Performs the same audio analysis as the main version
- **Flexible Saving**: Saves results to demo tables if they exist, or logs them as JSON

## Setup

### 1. Coda Tables Required

The demo uses these tables in your Coda document:

- **Demo Users Table** (`grid-LJUorNwMyd`): Contains demo user information with their conversation types, topics, skills, and prompts
- **Demo Topics Table** (`grid--uaem04-hg`): Contains conversation topics
- **Demo Prompts Table** (`grid-ZDdr3ovgSx`): Contains practice prompts with full details
- **Demo Skills Table** (`grid-65LBjWjbiz`): Contains skill definitions

### 2. Optional Demo Session Tables

For full functionality, create these tables manually in Coda:

**Demo Conversation Sessions Table:**
- username (Text)
- session_id (Text)
- date_time (Text)
- prompt (Text)
- user_transcription (Text)
- answer_duration (Number)
- wpm_score (Number)
- fluency_score (Number)
- vocabulary_score (Number)

**Demo Skill Sessions Table:**
- username (Text)
- session_id (Text)
- date_time (Text)
- skill_name (Text)
- skill_score (Number)
- skill_feedback (Text)

### 3. User Setup

Add demo users to the Demo Users table with these fields:
- `username`: The user's username
- `demo_conversation`: The type of conversation they're practicing
- `demo_topics`: Comma-separated list of topics they're working on
- `demo_skills`: Comma-separated list of skills they're developing
- `prompts`: Comma-separated list of specific prompts for this user

Example:
```
username: xinrong
demo_conversation: Job Interview
demo_topics: ðŸ’¼ Previous work experience,ðŸŽ¯ Why I'm applying for the job,ðŸªž My strengths and weaknesses
demo_skills: ðŸ§¾ Use professional and precise vocabulary,ðŸ’ª Show confidence in French,ðŸŽ“ Understand and apply French interview etiquette
prompts: Vous avez dÃ©mÃ©nagÃ© ici avec votre famille ?,Vous arrivez Ã  vous intÃ©rgrer, un peu ?
```

## Usage

1. Run the demo: `streamlit run demo.py`
2. Enter a username (must exist in the Demo Users table)
3. View your conversation type, topics, and skills
4. Get a random prompt from your specific prompt list
5. Record your response
6. View analysis results (analyzed against your specific skills)
7. Results are saved to demo tables (if they exist) or logged as JSON

## Differences from Main Version

- **Single Document**: All data is in one Coda document
- **Shared Tables**: Users share the same tables instead of having separate documents
- **User-Specific Prompts**: Each user has their own list of prompts instead of topic-based filtering
- **User-Specific Skills**: Analysis is performed against the user's specific skills
- **Simplified User Management**: No need for separate user documents
- **Display-Only Info**: Topics are shown but not used for filtering
- **Flexible Saving**: Gracefully handles missing demo tables

## Testing

Use the test script to verify table structure:
```bash
python test_demo_tables.py
```

## Demo Users

The demo works with any user in the central users table. For testing, you can use:
- `xinrong`
- `Jordaan`

Or add new users to the central users table.
